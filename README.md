# Standalone Comet-any

This repository extracts the Comet-any Creator and Engine seams from the upstream Comet checkout. It provides a focused, filesystem-based factory for creating and upgrading Skill packages, plus a private Engine foundation for loading, snapshotting, and running Engine-compatible Skills.

## Scope

The package includes:

- a shared workflow-kernel foundation behind the standalone Creator adapters;
- real local Skill discovery with stable source hashes, strict preferences, and ambiguity reporting;
- deterministic Workflow Contract normalization and validation;
- confirmed plan/state lifecycle in the standalone `.comet-any` namespace;
- generated entry and Node Skills with protocol/evidence references;
- current-hash evaluation, review approval, publication, and distribution preview;
- private Skill runtime loading, validation, content identity, and immutable snapshots;
- deterministic and adaptive Engine loop behavior with manual and standalone Run façades;
- protected Run state, pending-action, trajectory, artifact, context, and checkpoint storage;
- official/private differential observations for the pinned Engine behavior.

It intentionally excludes Comet Classic policy, Comet Native policy and hardening, Comet Entry, host platform installers, ambient resume routing, and external platform adapters.

## Run persistence

Run files are stored through protected, bounded, atomic adapters. Missing Run
state returns `null`; missing trajectory, pending-action, and checkpoint files
return `[]`, `null`, and `null`, respectively; missing artifacts return `{}`;
missing context returns `null`. Existing files are validated before recovery,
and unsafe references, path escapes, link traversal, oversized content, and
failed writes are rejected without replacing the last valid state.

## Standalone Run locations

Use `startStandaloneRun`, `resumeStandaloneRun`, `evaluateStandaloneRun`, and
`upgradeStandaloneRun` with a project root and a validated Run id. The adapter
maps each Run to `<projectRoot>/.comet/runs/<run-id>` and keeps the manual
Engine storage layout inside that location. It validates the id before
resolving or creating any Run path, and verifies that recovered state belongs
to the requested id. Execution, retry, snapshot, artifact, trajectory, eval,
and terminal behavior remains shared with the manual adapter.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm test
npm run build
npm run format:check
```

The CLI is `comet-any` after `npm run build`:

```bash
node bin/comet-any.js guide --project . --json
```

See `assets/skills/comet-any/SKILL.md` for the user-facing confirmation protocol and `docs/extraction-map.md` for upstream provenance.

The public package façade and `@rpamis/comet-any-private/engine` subpath export the Skill runtime and Engine operations needed by callers. Run-file storage and protected filesystem implementation modules remain internal. The Engine closure is pinned to Comet `0.4.0-beta.19` at revision `99fd7495f8b9217efbaae3a46d885f6fa7f4102a` and contains no runtime import from the upstream checkout.

The pinned three-Skill differential harness is documented in `docs/differential-harness.md`. The Engine parity matrix and certification gate are documented in `docs/engine-phase-1-certification.md`. Both harnesses run only in disposable temporary projects and reject protected raw-data paths.
